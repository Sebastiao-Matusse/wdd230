                <h2>Scenarios</h2>
                <p><b>July Mathew:</b> I Work a all day long and I usually don't have time to make a research for a
                    great trip in in Central Mozambique (Manica and Sofala). I would rather be happy finding somewhere
                    where I can see all the available options in theses pronvicies and a quicky reserve.</p>

                <p><b>Anthony:</b> I like Travelling, I am always seeking for new places to visit and explore the
                    nature. But it's difficult to find information about some cool places to visit in Manica and Sofala,
                    and someplaces you cannot even now if there are hotels nearby where you would to make the tour.</p>

                <p><b>Joseph:</b> I heard about some cool places to visit in central Manica and Sofala Provinces. I
                    worriead about the prices of visiting these places and there is no reliable information on the
                    internet. And I don't know who could guide me through these places, because some places people are
                    far from tha habitants and there is no hotels nearby with tour guides. I would love to visit these
                    places if there was people we could online who could guide us to visit some historical places.</p>
