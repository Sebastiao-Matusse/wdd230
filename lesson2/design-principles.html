                    <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                    <h3>BYU-Pathway Worldwide</h3>
                    <div class="site-link"><a href="https://www.byupathway.org/" target="_blank">byupathway.org</a>
                    </div>

                    <p>Visual Hierarchy is very important principle because it gives hints to the user how you want them
                        to
                        navigate the website - where to read, to click, etc. <br> Visual-hierarchy means how the
                        elements in
                        the website page are organized, in order of importance, to guide the user. And this can be done
                        using:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Size</li>
                        <li>Color</li>
                        <li>Contrast</li>
                        <li>Proximity</li>
                        <li>and many others</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the image example above we see that in the nav bar, the logo and the <em>"Apply For
                            Free"</em>
                        button stand out because of the bright yellow <strong>Color</strong> on them that
                        <strong>contrasts</strong> very well with the white color. And the <strong>size</strong> of the
                        logo
                        makes it stands out relatively more. Goind slightly down, our attention is drawn to the
                        <em>"Begin
                            Today"</em> button because of its color that stands out. <br>The same pattern is seen along
                        the
                        whole website.

                        pixlr.com applies well that law, it keeps simple and straightfoward options for the user.

                    <h2>Alignment</h2>
                    <h3>BYU-Pathway Worldwide</h3>
                    <div class="site-link"><a href="https://www.byupathway.org/" target="_blank">byupathway.org</a>
                    </div>

                    </div>
                    <p>BYU-Pathway Worldwide demonstrate strickly well the web design of Alignment.<br>
                        Alignment is basically to line up webpage elements. The elements can be vertically or
                        horizontally
                        aligned. We have vertical alignment when the elements stay on an invisible straight line from
                        top to
                        botton. This can be see the image above, the three elements are properly vertically aligned.
                    <p>
                    <p>The horizontal alignment is the opposity. We have the vertical alignment when the elements stay
                        on an
                        invisible straight line from right to left. In the image above we cannot see that alignment in
                        mobile view, but in the desktop or tablet version, we cn see that alignment.</p>
                    <p>We can also have the edge alignment, where the elements are all aligned to the left, right or
                        center,
                        however, we can have both, left and right edges aligned (justified).
                        <br> The three elements in the image above, the dollar sign icon, the computer icon and the
                        temple
                        icon are all center aligned (they line up on an straight center line), and their description
                        text is
                        justified.
